# Ecommerce-SKU-crawler
Few E-Commerce website crawlers via Python + BS3 + Selenium + mongoDB

One of my friends' request for crawling SKU data from few major luxury cloth brands saling E-Commerses' websites
This is my first time to implement web crawler and I started from scratch by studying basic python scripts
Therefore the python scripts might look really rough and low efficient. If anyone is interested in improvment by all means! :)

Altough I am not sure about the legal part, I didn't upload the result SKU data. Use the scripts with your own responsibility.
